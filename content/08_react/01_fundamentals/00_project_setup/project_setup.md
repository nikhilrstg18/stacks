## Tools for React projects

- **Purpose:** Create a starter template, transform JSX → JS, bundle/minify files, host with a dev server.
- **Productivity:** Auto‑reload browser on file changes, preview UI instantly.
- **Deployment:** Tools generate optimized production builds.
- **Options:**
  - Configure manually (time‑consuming).
  - Use preconfigured environments → **Vite** (fast, simple) or **Next.js** (feature‑rich).
- **Course choice:** Start with **Vite** for fundamentals; apply knowledge later in **Next.js**.
