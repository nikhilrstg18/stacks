1. **Want to write clean code**❓

   The first step in writing clean code is to organize the code into appropriate classes using object-oriented programming techniques.

2. **Want to defend your code against errors both now and in the future**❓

   The first step in integrating defensive coding techniques is to organize the code into appropriate classes using object- oriented programming techniques.

3. **Want to use an iterative or agile approach to building your software**❓

   The first step is to organize the code into appropriate classes using object-oriented programming techniques.

4. **Need to build an API or application programming interface for your application**❓

   Yeah, if you are building a software product, management wants an API even though they probably don't know what it is. Every cool product now provides an API, right

The first step in building a good API is to organize the code into appropriate classes using object-oriented programming techniques.

5. **Want to understand and implement design patterns**❓

   Design patterns are based on object- oriented programming concepts.

6. **Want to use domain-driven design principles**❓

   Domain-driven design is based on object- oriented programming concepts.

7. **Want to build a cool .NET app**❓

   The first step in building any .NET application is to organize the code into appropriate classes using object-oriented programming techniques.

So, understanding and using object-oriented programming techniques is the foundation of many other approaches, best practices, patterns, and architectures. Let's start our journey into object-oriented programming with a few definitions.

> remember by A-PIE

There are 4 pillars of Object Oriented Programming

1. Encapsulation - `Security | High cohesion`
2. Inheritence - `Reusability`
3. Polymorphism - `Flexibilty | Usability`
4. Abstraction - `Simplicity | Usability`
