> Now we’re going to talk about how real data flows through the model

## Step-by-Step Flow of Vectors (Tensors)

Now that we’ve seen the major components of the model, let’s start to look at the various vectors/tensors and how they flow between these components to turn the input of a trained model into an output.

- First, understand [Encoder Side](./00_encoder_side/)
- To get the most out of these sections, get familiar with: [Attention Mechanism](./01_attention_mechanism/) at this point covering:
  - Self-Attention
  - Calculating Self-Attention
  - Matrix Calculation of Self-Attention
  - Multi-Headed Attention
- Second, understand [Decoder Side](./02_decoder_side/)
