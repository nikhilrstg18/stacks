> Residual + normalization helps the Transformer stay stable, efficient, and deep — without losing information or training control.

One detail in the architecture of the encoder that we need to mention before moving on, is that each sub-layer (self-attention, FF-NN) in each encoder has a residual connection around it, and is followed by a [layer-normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450) step.

If we’re to visualize the vectors and the layer-norm operation associated with self attention, it would look like this:

This goes for the sub-layers of the decoder as well. If we’re to think of a Transformer of 2 stacked encoders and decoders, it would look something like this:
