## Language Model

A `LM` is model that assings probabilities to a sequence of words to proedict the next best word

eg. The sun rises in the \_\_\_\_\_\_ (east)

The sun rises in the east -> Highest Probility
The sun rises in the west -> lowest Probility

The way in which the data is created is using something called as a self supervised learning.

We'll start with assumption `LM`s have become universal solvers.
