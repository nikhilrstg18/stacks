## Why GPUs for AI

- Parallel processing capabilities allow for faster computations in machine learning and deep learning
- Essential for handling the massive data and complex operations in Large Language Model (LLM) training and inference.

**LLMs require massive computations**

- Billions of parameters in transformer-based models demand high-speed processing.
- Training involves billions of matrix multiplications in each forward and backward pass.
- Parallelism in GPUs speeds up training:
- Unlike CPUs, which execute a few tasks sequentially, GPUs handle thousands of operations in parallel.
- Memory Optimization:
- LLMs require large memory bandwidth, and GPUs with high VRAM (e.g., NVIDIA A100 with 80GB VRAM) can store large model weights.

## GPUs in LLM Training

- `Forward propagation`: Compute predictions using input data.
- `Backward propagation`: Adjust weights using gradients.
- `Optimization`: Use techniques like AdamW to minimize loss.

**How GPUs accelerate LLM training**

- `Matrix Multiplications`: GPUs process large tensor operations efficiently.
- `Batch Processing`: Train on multiple data samples simultaneously.
- `Distributed Training`: GPUs work across multiple machines using frameworks like NVIDIA NCCL.

## GPUs in LLM Inference

- `Training` requires backpropagation, but inference only needs forward propagation.
- `Inference` must be fast and efficient for real-time applications (e.g., chatbots).

**Optimizations for Faster Inference**:

- `Quantization`: Reducing precision (e.g., FP32 â†’INT8) for faster execution.
- `Tensor Parallelism`: Distributing computation across multiple GPUs.
- `Caching Techniques`: Storing frequent computations for faster responses.
  Role of GPUs in LLM Inference

## Why use multiple GPUs?

- A single GPU cannot handle the massive computational load of LLMs.
- Distributed training enables scaling across thousands of GPUs.
  Techniques for Multi-GPU Training:
- `Data Parallelism`: Each GPU trains on a different batch of data.
- `Model Parallelism`: Model is split across multiple GPUs (e.g., tensor parallelism).
- `Pipeline Parallelism`: Stages of model training are assigned to different GPUs
