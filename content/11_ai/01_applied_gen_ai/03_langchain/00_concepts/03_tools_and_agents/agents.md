## Langchain Tools

Scenario: _“AI Assistant for Bookstore Operations”_

You’re building a smart assistant for a local bookstore that:

- Answers customer queries
- Summarizes book descriptions
- Recommends books based on genre
- Tracks inventory
- Automates staff tasks using tool

```py:title=Bookstore_Assistant
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain_ollama.chat_models import ChatOllama
from langchain.tools import Tool, tool
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

# Step 1: Prompt Template
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    "Suggest a book in the {genre} genre under {page_limit} pages."
)

# Step 2: Connect to LLM
llm = ChatOllama(
    model="llama3.2",
    temperature=0.3,
    top_p=0.9,
    max_tokens=100
)
# Step 3: Create the chain
chain = prompt | llm

response = chain.invoke({"genre": "mystery", "page_limit": "300"})
print(response.text())

# Step 4: create tool instance using Tool.from_function
def check_inventory(title: str) -> str:
    """
    Checks the availability of a book in the inventory.

    Args:
        title (str): The title of the book to check.

    Returns:
        str: A message indicating whether the book is available or out of stock.

    Example:
        >>> check_inventory("The Alchemist")
        'The Alchemist is available.'

        >>> check_inventory("Inferno")
        'Inferno is out of stock.'
    """
    print("Checking Inventory...")
    inventory = {"The Alchemist": 5, "Inferno": 0}
    count = inventory.get(title, 0)
    return f"{title} is {'available' if count > 0 else 'out of stock'}."

inventory_tool = Tool.from_function(
    name="InventoryChecker",
    description="Checks if a book is in stock",
    func=check_inventory
)

# Here's what each parameter does:
# - name="InventoryChecker": This is the identifier for the tool. It’s how the tool will be referenced when invoked by an agent or orchestrator.
# - description="Checks if a book is in stock": A short summary of the tool’s purpose. This helps agents decide when to use it.
# - func=check_inventory: The actual Python function that performs the logic. In this case, it checks the book's availability.

# Step 6: Add Calculator Tool (Optional)
@tool
def simple_calculator(expression: str) -> str:
    """Evaluates a basic math expression like '2 + 2'."""
    return str(eval(expression))

# Step 7: Create Agent with Tools
print(f"\nAgent With Tools")


tools = [inventory_tool, simple_calculator]
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    handle_parsing_errors=True,
    verbose=True)

agent.run("Is 'The Alchemist' available?")

# Step 8: Add Memory (Conversation Tracking)

print(f"\nAgent With Tools and Memory")

memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")

agent_with_memory = initialize_agent(
    tools, llm,
    agent=AgentType.CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    memory=memory,
    handle_parsing_errors=True,
    verbose=True
)
agent_with_memory.run("Is 'The Alchemist' available?")
agent_with_memory.run("I like fantasy books. Recommend one.")
agent_with_memory.run("Is that book in stock?")
agent_with_memory.run("Is 'The Alchemist' available?")

for msg in memory.chat_memory.messages:
    print(f"{msg.type.upper()}: {msg.content}")

```

I'd like to recommend "The Silent Patient" by Alex Michaelides, which has approximately 336 pages (depending on the edition). However, I can suggest an alternative that fits your request:

"The Last Time I Lied" by Riley Sager is a psychological mystery novel with around 272 pages. The story follows Emma Davis, who returns to the summer camp where her friends disappeared 15 years ago, only to find herself in the middle of a new mystery.

If you're looking for something even shorter, consider:

- "The Devil Crept In" by Ania Ahlborn (224 pages): A psychological thriller about a young boy who goes missing in a small town, and the strange occurrences that follow his disappearance.
- "The Last House Guest" by Megan Miranda (272 pages): A mystery novel about a woman who becomes embroiled in a murder investigation at a summer rental property.

All of these books are under 300 pages and offer engaging mysteries to keep you guessing!

### Comparison

| Aspect                | `inventory_tool`                                      | `simple_calculator`                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Function Name**     | `check_inventory`                                     | `simple_calculator`                                 |
| **Tool Declaration**  | `Tool.from_function(...)`                             | `@tool` decorator                                   |
| **Purpose**           | Checks book availability from a static inventory      | Evaluates basic math expressions using `eval()`     |
| **Return Type**       | Availability message (`str`)                          | Evaluation result as string (`str`)                 |
| **Metadata**          | Explicit `name` and `description` passed as arguments | Implicitly derived from function name and docstring |
| **Integration Style** | Manual wrapping (likely LangChain-style)              | Declarative (LangChain-style with decorator syntax) |

### Tool Declaration Styles Explained

### 1. `Tool.from_function(...)` — Manual Registration

This is a **programmatic approach** to registering a tool. You explicitly pass:

- `name`: How the tool will be referenced by agents.
- `description`: What the tool does (used for routing decisions).
- `func`: The actual callable function.

This is useful when:

- You want to dynamically register tools.
- You need to wrap existing functions without modifying their source.
- You want more control over naming and metadata.

### 2. `@tool` — Declarative Decorator

This is a **Pythonic, declarative approach** using a decorator. It automatically:

- Registers the function as a tool.
- Uses the function name as the tool name.
- Uses the docstring as the tool description.

This is cleaner and more concise, especially when:

- You're writing tools from scratch.
- You want minimal boilerplate.
- You're using LangChain or similar frameworks that support decorators.

---

### Functional Intent

- `check_inventory` is **domain-specific** — it checks a book’s availability from a hardcoded dictionary.
- `simple_calculator` is **generic utility** — it evaluates any valid math expression passed as a string.

⚠️ **Note on `eval()`**: While powerful, `eval()` can be dangerous if not sandboxed. In production, you'd want to validate or restrict input to avoid security risks.

### Summary

- Use `Tool.from_function` when you need **explicit control** over tool registration.
- Use `@tool` when you want **clean, declarative syntax** and are writing tools inline.
- Both approaches are valid in agentic frameworks like LangChain — just depends on your architecture and preference.

## Exercise

🧩 Feature: Customer Support Agent
As a customer interacting with our system,
I want to receive accurate and timely responses to common queries,
So that I can resolve my concerns efficiently without human intervention.

**Scenario 1**: Retrieve FAQ Information

- Given a user asks about return policies, shipping timelines, or support turnaround times
- And a structured JSON dataset is available as the source of truth
- When the FAQ tool is invoked
- Then the system should return the relevant information from the JSON database
- And fallback to hardcoded responses if the data is missing or incomplete

**Scenario 2**: Check Order Status

- Given a user provides an order identifier
- When the order status tool is triggered
- Then the system should return the current status of the order
- And use simulated or hardcoded data if real-time tracking is unavailable

**Scenario 3**: Agent Orchestration

- Given a user submits a query
- When the agent interprets the intent
- Then it should route the request to the appropriate tool (FAQ or Order Status)
- And respond with a clear, context-aware answer
- And gracefully handle edge cases using predefined fallback logi
