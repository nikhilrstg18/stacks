## Introduction to LLM

Immerse yourself in the fascinating world of **Large Language Model**s aka `LLM`s and their pivotal role in processing and understanding natural language. Get acquainted with the `GPT` series and navigate through the lifecycle stages of `LLM`s, training, customizing and inferencing.

### Key aspects of LLM

- `LLM`s are powerful `neural network`s desgined to understand and generate human like text
- `LLM`s learn from vast amount of
  - Text Data
  - Capturing Grammer
  - Context
  - Semantics

- The **G**enerative **P**re-Trainined **T**ransformer aka `GPT` series is a prominent example of `LLM`s

- Transformer can generate tasks like
  - Translations
  - Summarization
  - Creating Writing

### LLM Lifecycle
  - Learning from Data
    - model acquire language pattern and representations from vast amount of unlabled text data
  - Specializing for tasks
    - they train on labeled data such as sentiment analysis and translationt o specialize for specific tasks
  - Generating Responses

### LLMs find applications in various NLP tasks 

including

- Text generation
- Translation
- Questions answering
- Chatbots

We will cover **AI Lifecycle for LLMs** including

- Traning
- Customizing
- Inferencing
